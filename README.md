The Project helped me to gain tons of knowledge on both front end and backend development, i learnt a lot of key concepts in javascript and REST API functionalities.
In addition, I gained adept knowledge on state management with redux toolkit and also had the oppurtunity to work with nextjs 13.4 and it's latest features which includes RSC, app route handlers and SSR.

## Installation

Apple Ecommerce requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) v10+ to run.

Install the dependencies and devDependencies and start the server.

**To get started with this project follow the steps:**

- Clone the repository to your local machine

```sh
cd apple-redesign
//Install the dependencies using
npm install
//run the development server using
npm run dev

//Open http://localhost:3000 with your browser to see the result
```

For production environments...

```sh
npm run build --production
```

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
